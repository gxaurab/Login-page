# Login Page for a Website

You can use this login page on your website by using the following command: `git clone "https://github.com/gxaurab/Login-page.git"`

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this login page, you will need to have the following software and languages installed on your computer: 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP as a server-side scripting language
- XAMPP installed

### Image Generation

I have used the Unsplash API to generate random images that will appear on the login page's home screen.

### Registration

There is a separate registration page that will update the data to the database when a user registers.

### Running the Login Page

To view the login page, open `localhost:/1313` in your web browser.
